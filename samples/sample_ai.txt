In today's fast-paced digital environment, organizations are increasingly leveraging artificial intelligence to optimize operations, enhance user engagement, and deliver scalable solutions. Language models, such as GPT-based architectures, have revolutionized natural language processing tasks by demonstrating significant improvements in contextual understanding and generation capabilities.

One notable advantage of these models is their ability to generate human-like text across a wide range of topics with minimal supervision. As these systems continue to evolve, questions surrounding authorship attribution and content authenticity have become increasingly relevant. Consequently, developing tools to identify AI-generated text is a growing area of interest in both academic and industrial domains.

The implications of indistinguishable machine-generated content are profound and necessitate robust detection strategies.
